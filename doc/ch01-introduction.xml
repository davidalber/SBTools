  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The <package>SBTools</package> framework is a Python package
  designed to provide a unified interface for console-based (i.e.,
  text-based) systems biology tools written in Python. This guide
  discusses all aspects of framework, including downloading and
  installation (<xref linkend="ch.installation"/>), usage of the
  <command>sbtools</command> command (<xref linkend="ch.usage"/>), the
  framework design (<xref linkend="ch.design"/>), and how to create
  new plug-ins for use within the framework (<xref
  linkend="ch.developing-plugins"/>).</para>

  <para><package>SBTools</package> end users need only read up through
  <xref linkend="ch.usage"/>. Parties interested in producing plug-ins
  for <package>SBTools</package> will also benefit from the content in
  the final chapters.</para>

    <title>History</title>
    <para>The first incarnation of <package>SBTools</package> (at that
    time called <package>SBMLTools</package>) was developed to
    organize a growing set of Python tools written for manipulating
    Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models at the National
    Renewable Energy Laboratory. The number of available tools reached
    a point at which it became justifiable to reorganize them as
    subcommands within a single piece of software. This decision led
    to the creation of a system, <package>SBMLTools</package>, with a
    single interface that offered several tools to users. New tools
    were released through <package>SBMLTools</package>, enabling users
    to discover them more quickly.</para>

    <para>This organization model was effective in many ways, but the
    implementation proved to be too rigid with regards to future
    development. The main interface of <package>SBMLTools</package>
    was tightly coupled to the tools themselves, which naturally led
    to a very centralized model of development with little hope of
    people outside the core development group contributing. The
    rigidity of <package>SBMLTools</package> coupled with the
    recognition that other systems biology groups were undoubtedly
    writing console-based tools in Python led to the design of a more
    modular system, <package>SBTools</package>.</para>

    <para><package>SBTools</package> offers the features that worked
    well in <package>SBMLTools</package>, but is different in that it
    is a plug-in system. Tools are written as plug-ins and, once
    installed, these plug-ins are detected by
    <package>SBTools</package> and made available to users. This
    approach decouples the development of the tools from the
    framework, allowing for a much less centralized development model
    in which developers anywhere are now able to produce plug-ins to
    run in the framework.</para>

    <sidebar><title>Specificity of <package>SBTools</package></title>
    <para>Although <package>SBTools</package> was designed with
    systems biology software tools in mind, the framework design is
    not specific to systems biology. Any application or field that
    could benefit from a similar plug-in model could use
    <package>SBTools</package> or a version of it adapted to fit
    particular needs.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Version 0.5 (<date>January 29, 2009</date>)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Redefined the <package>SBTools</package> interface
	      so that plug-in subcommands and alternate subcommands
	      are no longer defined inside the plug-in class. This
	      spares <package>SBTools</package> from having to create
	      an object for each plug-in to extract basic information
	      about the plug-in.</para>

	      <para>The new scheme has plug-in developers define the
	      name and subcommands in the entry point in the
	      <filename>setup.py</filename> file.</para>

	<term>Version 0.4 (<date>January 14, 2009</date>)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Added exception handling to detect missing
	      dependencies, unsatisfied dependency versions, and bad
	      entry points for plug-ins. When one of these conditions
	      occurs, the affected plug-in is skipped. In previous
	      versions, these situations caused
	      <package>SBTools</package> to exit due to unhandled
	      exceptions.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Changed <methodname>__init__</methodname> method
	      of the <classname>SBToolOptionParser</classname>
	      class. This method must now be called with the
	      <package>SBTools</package> object, in addition to the
	      previously required parameters.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Added the <command>--verbose-load</command> command-line
	      option for <command>sbtools</command>. When <command>
	      sbtools --verbose-load</command> is run,
	      <package>SBTools</package> prints the packages and
	      plug-ins detected, and if plug-ins are successfully
	      loaded. When a plug-in cannot be loaded, a message
	      describing the cause is printed.</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Did away with the plug-in directory. Plug-ins are
	      now installed like other modules, which makes

	      independent.</para>
