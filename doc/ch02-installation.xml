  <title>Installation</title>

  <para>This chapter discusses where to find and how to install the
  <package>SBTools</package> framework package. Although the
  directions apply specifically to the <package>SBTools</package>
  framework, installation of plug-ins developed for the framework
  proceeds similarly.</para>

  <para>The <package>SBTools</package> framework depends only on the
  presence of a <link
  xlink:href="http://www.python.org/">Python</link>
  interpreter. <package>SBTools</package> has been tested with Python
  2.5 and Python 2.6, but may work with other versions of the 2.*
  interpreter.</para>

  <sidebar><title>Installation Dependency Resolution</title>
  <para>It is not absolutely necessary to install
  <package>SBTools</package> prior to installing any
  plug-ins. <package>SBTools</package> and <package>SBTools</package>
  plug-ins are packaged and distributed using <link
  xlink:title="setuptools"
  xlink:href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</link>. When
  properly set up, the framework and plug-ins declare their software
  dependencies, which are then handled at installation
  time. Therefore, plug-ins should declare <package>SBTools</package>
  as a dependency, causing the framework to be automatically
  installed, if it is not already present, the first time a plug-in is
  installed.</para>
  </sidebar>

  <para>Two install methods are available, depending on software on
  your system. The first method is available if your system has
  <command>easy_install</command> installed. If you are not sure,
  follow the directions in <xref
  linkend="ch.installation-sec.without-easy_install"/>.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="ch.installation-sec.with-easy_install">
    <title>Installation with <command>easy_install</command></title>

    <para>This section describes the installation procedure on a
    system with <command>easy_install</command> available.</para>

    <para>This method uses <command>easy_install</command> to fetch
    the package over the internet and install it. Do the following
    in a terminal:</para>

    <screen>$ easy_install sbtools</screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="ch.installation-sec.without-easy_install">
    <title>Installation without
    <command>easy_install</command></title>

    <para>This section describes the installation procedure on a
    system that do not have <command>easy_install</command>
    installed.</para>

    <para>In this approach, you need to manually download the <package>SBTools</package>
    &version; distribution (the file named
    <filename>sbtools-&version;.tar.gz</filename>) from <link
    xlink:href="http://www.nrel.gov/"/>. Next, extract the files from
    the archive:</para>

    <screen>$ tar zxf sbtools-&version;.tar.gz</screen>

    <para>This creates the directory <filename
    class="directory">sbtools-&version;</filename>. To complete the
    installation, do:</para>

    <screen>$ cd sbtools-&version;
$ python setup.py install</screen>

    <note>
      <para>Following the completion of these steps, your system will
      have <command>easy_install</command>.</para>
    </note>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Did it work?</title>

    <para>With either installation approach it should be clear if the
    installation failed due to some error. If the installation appears
    to have worked, then the <command>sbtools</command> command should
    now be available to you on the command line. Try typing</para>

    <screen>$ sbtools help</screen>

    <para>to verify that <command>sbtools</command> is now present.</para>

    <para>If the installation was successful then see the next chapter
    (<xref linkend="ch.usage"/>) for documentation on using the
    <command>sbtools</command>.</para>
